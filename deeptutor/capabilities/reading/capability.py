"""Immersive-reading loop capability.

Active whenever the turn carries an open reading material. It augments the
normal chat surface (it is not a :class:`KnowledgeCapability` — the user keeps
web search, code execution and everything else) with the five reading tools, and
tells the model three things it cannot infer: what document is open, where the
user is currently looking, and how to cite.

**The locate pre-pass.** The capability implements the optional async
``pre_loop`` hook, but *without* a second LLM loop: it runs the same
deterministic search the model would have run, on the user's own question, and
folds the hits into the turn's seed. That choice is deliberate —

* it costs no tokens and adds no latency before the first token,
* it is fully deterministic, so it can be tested rather than sampled, and
* it fixes the real failure it exists for: weak models under native tool calling
  often never call a read tool at all (the same observation
  :mod:`deeptutor.capabilities.explore_context` was built around). Handing the
  model "your question matches page 12 and page 17" up front means grounding
  happens even when the model would not have asked for it.

**Why materials do not enter ``source_index``.** Reading material is addressed by
locator through this capability's own store, never flattened into the per-turn
attached-sources map. That keeps ``ExploreContextCapability`` inactive on reading
turns (it activates on a non-empty ``source_index``), so the two pre-passes can
never both read the same document — no coordination code required in either.
