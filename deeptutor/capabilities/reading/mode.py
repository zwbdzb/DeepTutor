"""Immersive Reading capability — the chat agent loop, reading a document.

There is no bespoke pipeline: the standard agentic chat loop IS the reader. This
capability only marks the turn and runs that pipeline. Everything specific to
reading is contributed by the loop capability
(:class:`deeptutor.capabilities.reading.capability.ReadingCapability`), which
mounts the reading tools, binds the open material server-side, injects the
reading playbook and runs the deterministic locate pre-pass.

The split matters for a practical reason: the *mode* is what the user picks in
the composer, while the *loop capability* activates on whether a document is
actually open. Selecting the mode with no document open therefore still gives a
perfectly ordinary chat turn — the reader panel is showing its file picker, and
there is nothing to ground an answer in yet.

Design axiom (shared with chat / solve / mastery): the intelligence lives at the
loop's exit — the model decides what to read and what to cite — while the
deterministic parts (which units exist, whether a quote is really on the page it
claims) are engine calls behind tools.
