"""Mastery path loop-capability hooks.

A posed question ends its turn (see
:meth:`MasteryLoopCapability.final_text_override`), which is what removed this
module's most tangled machinery. A mastery question used to travel on the
generic ``ask_user`` pause channel, so every clarifying card the tutor raised
had to be inspected and rewritten in case it was really a quiz, and the
learner's reply to any card had to be considered as a possible answer to the
open question. Both were guesses about which card was which, made in the wrong
place. Now the engine poses its own card and answers arrive as ordinary
messages committed at turn start, so ``ask_user`` is left alone: in this mode
it is only ever a clarifying question.
