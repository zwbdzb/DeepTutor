"""The mastery tutoring loop.

Mastery used to be a chat turn wearing a hat: the chat pipeline ran, and a
loop extension added nine tools and one system block on top of chat's own
playbook. That block then had to spend most of its length *arguing* with the
prompt above it — "this differs from ordinary chat, where ask_user is just a
tool", "posing a question ends the turn", "never write the choices as plain
text" — because the model had already been told, in the block before, how an
ordinary exploring turn behaves.

This class is the same loop engine with the tutor's own protocol stated first
instead. :class:`MasteryPromptAssembler` replaces the foundation of the system
prompt — identity, standing policy, what a round means — so "posing a question
ends the turn" arrives as this loop's native turn semantics rather than as an
exception to somebody else's.

What is deliberately *not* changed is the tool surface. A mastery turn mounts
exactly what a chat turn would (the learner's own composer toggles, the same
auto-mount rules) plus the mastery tools, so moving into a course never
silently takes a tool away. Narrowing that surface is a one-line override here
if it ever proves worth doing — which is the point of having this class at all.
