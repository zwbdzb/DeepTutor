"""Mastery Path tools — the seam between the chat-loop tutor and the pure
mastery engine (:mod:`deeptutor.learning`).

These tools are auto-mounted only when a mastery path is active on the
turn (via the chat loop mastery capability). The chat agent loop IS the tutor;
these tools let it read the gate and record outcomes, while the pedagogy —
what to teach, how to question, when to explain — stays the model's job. The
arithmetic (mastery, gate, spaced repetition) stays in the engine.

The active path id is injected server-side by the pipeline as
``_mastery_path_id``; the model never supplies it. Each call constructs a
fresh store + service (matching the REST router) so concurrent turns can't
race on a shared object.

    ``mastery_build`` is the blunt instrument: it replaces the whole outline,

    is bounded by the module objective written when the outline was designed —
    the tutor may reword, retype, drop and add knowledge points, but the
    ability the module promises stays fixed. That is what keeps "I don't like
    this one" from quietly turning into a different module.

    Two invariants protect the gate:

    * A rewritten knowledge point gets a **fresh id**, so the evidence that
      cleared the old wording is not silently claimed for the new one. The
      engine drops that point's stale state itself (``replace_modules``); the
      result names what was reset so the tutor can tell the learner.
    * A **mastered** knowledge point is refused, for rewrite and removal
      alike. It is proven work, and erasing it to satisfy a passing dislike
      would delete the one thing the learner cannot re-earn for free.
