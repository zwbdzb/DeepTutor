"""What a mastery conversation is doing right now.

Three things are deliberately separate here, and keeping them separate is the
whole point of this module:

* the **engine** — one agent loop, the same reasoning substrate in every mode;
* the **mode** — which prompt block frames the sitting and which tools it may
  use;
* the **session** — the conversation the learner is actually having, which
  carries a *current* mode and can change it.

A mode is therefore mutable state on a session, not a property of it. The tutor
changes it with ``mastery_mode`` when the learner asks for something the
current mode cannot do; the learner changes it by pressing one of the three
buttons above the transcript. Either way the conversation continues — nobody
has to open a new one to fix a knowledge point.

Why the mode is enforced when a tool is *called*, not when it is mounted
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The obvious implementation is to mount only the current mode's tools. It was
the first one here, and it cannot survive a mutable mode: a turn's tool
schemas *and* its system prompt are both assembled once, before the first
round (see ``AgenticLoopPipeline.run``), so a mode changed mid-turn would win
no new tools until the next one. "Call a tool to unlock that mode's tools"
would then be false for the turn that called it.

So every mastery tool is mounted every turn, and the ones that belong to a
mode check :func:`ensure_mode` when they run. The guarantee the learner cares
about is identical — an outline sitting still cannot examine them, because the
engine refuses — it just moves from mount time to call time. What the model
pays is a few extra schemas it should not reach for, and the refusal it gets
back names the tool that would unlock them.

``mastery_mode`` returns the new mode's instructions in its own result for the
same reason: the system prompt above it still describes the mode the turn
started in, and a tool result is the only thing that can correct it without
waiting for the next turn.

#: * **Examining the learner** belongs to ``study`` and ``review``. An outline
#:   sitting has nothing agreed to examine on yet.
