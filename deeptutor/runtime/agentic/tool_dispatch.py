"""Parallel tool-call dispatch with per-tool sub-traces.

Lifted from chat's pipeline. Capability-agnostic: the caller supplies:

* a ``KwargAugmenter`` — how to enrich the LLM-supplied tool args with
  server-side context (e.g. chat injects ``source_index`` for ``read_source``;
  solve will do the same for its own tools).
* a ``RetrieveMetaFactory`` — how to derive a "retrieve" trace variant for
  rag-flavored tools. This is a LABEL concern only: every tool call streams
  its running/terminal state and its intermediate progress into its own
  sub-trace regardless of flavor.
* labels for the trace UI rows (``tool_call``, ``retrieve``) plus the
  capability-specific copy for empty results / over-quota / tool failures.

The dispatcher executes all tool calls in parallel, emits one sub-trace per
tool call, and returns a :class:`DispatchOutcome` carrying the role=tool
messages, accumulated sources, and pause/terminate signals for the loop.
