r"""Protocol-label parsing for streaming LLM responses.

The agentic engine drives LLM calls with a ``\`\`LABEL\`\`+content`` protocol:
prompts require one allowed label, double-backtick-wrapped, on the first line
of every reply, then the rest of the content. The parser detects that label
up front, tolerates a few provider/model formatting slips, and routes the
post-label stream accordingly.

Label sets are caller-supplied: the research block loop uses
``(THINK, TOOL, APPEND, FINISH)``, its report sub-phases take a single
terminal label each (``(OUTLINE,)``, ``(INTRO,)``, ``(SECTION,)``, ...), and
the question and PageIndex loops use ``(THINK, TOOL, FINISH)``.

Chat is **not** one of those callers, and neither is anything else running on
the chat loop (mastery, reading, ...). Chat carried this protocol until
``46093e5e`` (2026-06-11) and now drives its rounds through native tool
calling instead: a round that carries ``tool_calls`` is a tool round, a round
without them finishes the turn, and no label is ever asked of the model.
Reasoning the model writes into the *content* channel is recognised there
only when tagged ``<think>``, which ``InlineThinkFilter`` in
``deeptutor.agents.loop.agent_loop`` splits off at streaming time.

    Returns ``(label, after_text)`` once an allowed label is detected after any

    Returns ``None`` while the buffer is too short or still a partial prefix

    must fall back to :data:`LABEL_UNKNOWN` once the buffer exceeds
    :data:`LABEL_PROBE_MAX_CHARS` without a match.

    Accepts the wrapped form (``\`\`LABEL\`\``` preferred, with common
    one-/three-backtick variants tolerated) and a bare fallback (``LABEL``
    followed by a separator) — some models drop or alter the backticks on
    one-shot prompts and the bare form is unambiguous as long as the
    protocol labels are all-uppercase tokens. The wrapped form may be
    followed immediately by body text because Markdown inline-code styling
    visually separates the label even when the raw stream has no whitespace
    (for example ``\`\`FINISH\`\`你好``).

    ``final=True`` means the caller knows no more chunks are coming, so an
    exact bare label such as ``FINISH`` can be accepted even without a
