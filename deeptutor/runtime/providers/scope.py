"""What a turn needs to know to decide which provider tools it may use.

Deliberately a plain input record, not a protocol every provider must
implement: MCP and CLI apps differ in what their grants are keyed by (tool
names vs. app ids), in what "not ready" means, and in whether preloading is
even meaningful. Forcing one policy interface over both would buy a shared
type and pay for it with per-kind branches hidden inside it. The branches
live in :mod:`deeptutor.runtime.providers.authorize`, named and readable.
