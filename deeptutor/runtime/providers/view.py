"""Assemble one turn's external-provider tool surface.

This is the composition seam that used to live inline in the chat pipeline:
start the providers, work out what this caller may use, filter the pool,
build the progressive-disclosure loader, and render the manifest block. It
lives here so the policy is testable on its own and so a second consumer (or
a second provider kind) does not mean a second copy inside a pipeline.

Contract: :func:`build_tool_view` **never raises**. A provider that is down,
misconfigured, or slow degrades to "no external tools this turn" — the turn
itself must still run.
