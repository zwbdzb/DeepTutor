BookEngine
==========

Top-level orchestrator for the Book Engine. Sits **parallel** to
``ChatOrchestrator`` (i.e. it is **not** a ``TurnCapability``) and is the
single public entry point used by the API router, CLI, and SDK.

Lifecycle
---------

::

    create_book(...)         → BookProposal       (Stage 1, requires user confirm)
    confirm_proposal(...)    → Spine              (Stage 2, requires user confirm)
    confirm_spine(...)       → page shells + queued compilation
    compile_page(book, page) → Page               (Stage 3-4, drives BookCompiler)
    resume_book(...)         → re-queue unfinished pages, keeping what exists
    rebuild_book(...)        → discard every page and regenerate from the spine
    list_books(), load_book(), delete_book()

Compilation queue
-----------------

Each book gets a ``_BookRuntime``: an ``asyncio.Queue`` of pending pages, one
background worker, and an **in-flight table** keyed by page id. Every path that
can compile a page — the reader opening one, the worker reaching one, a forced
regenerate — goes through :meth:`BookEngine.compile_page`, which consults that
table so concurrent requests for the same page join a single run instead of
racing into duplicate generations.

The worker trips a breaker (``CONSECUTIVE_PAGE_FAILURE_LIMIT``) when pages fail
for provider-level reasons, pausing the book rather than grinding the remaining
chapters into half-generated debris.

Progress is published to the book's long-lived stream in :mod:`.event_hub`,
never to a request-scoped bus — background compilation must keep streaming
after the call that queued it has returned.
