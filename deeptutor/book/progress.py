"""
Reading progress
================

Where the reader is in a book, what they have bookmarked, and how they did on
its quizzes.

Pure functions over a :class:`Progress` value — no storage, no engine, no IO.
Two reasons:

- The engine stays a scheduler. Progress is a different concern with different
  rules, and mixing them is what left ``visited_page_ids`` and
  ``bookmarked_page_ids`` declared but never written for the whole life of the
  feature.
- Immersive reading tracks the same three things (position, bookmarks,
  comprehension checks) in its own silo. When those merge, this is the layer
  that generalises, and it can be tested without a filesystem.

Derived, not accumulated
------------------------

``score`` and ``weak_chapters`` are recomputed from the **latest** attempt per
question rather than incremented as attempts arrive. Accumulating meant
re-answering a question you already knew inflated your score, and a chapter
stayed "weak" forever once you had missed anything in it — a progress display
that only ever ratchets one way tells the reader nothing.
