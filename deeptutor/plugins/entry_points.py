"""Load an entry-point group without letting one bad plugin take the app down.

DeepTutor exposes two plugin groups — ``deeptutor.plugins`` for capabilities the
registry can run, ``deeptutor.loop_capabilities`` for chat-loop capabilities —
and both need the same plumbing: read the group, import each target, hand it to
a group-specific coercer, and skip whatever fails with a warning naming the
entry point. Only the coercer differs, so only the coercer lives at the call
site.

Third-party code runs at import time here, which is what an entry point is; the
guarantee this module makes is narrower and worth stating plainly: a plugin that
raises cannot stop the others from loading.
