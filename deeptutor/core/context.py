    Everything a capability or tool needs to process a single user turn.

    Attributes:
        session_id: Persistent conversation identifier.
        user_message: The current user input.
        conversation_history: Previous messages in OpenAI format.
        enabled_tools: Tool names the user has toggled on (Level 1).
            ``None`` means "not specified", while ``[]`` means
            "explicitly disable all optional tools".
        allowed_builtin_tools: Whitelist gating the built-in auto-mounted tools
            (rag / read_memory / web_fetch / …). ``None`` (the product-chat
            default) means "no gating" — every built-in mounts under its usual
            context condition. A list restricts which built-ins may mount;
            partners set this so an owner can deny built-ins per companion.
        active_capability: Capability name selected by the user, or None for plain chat.
        knowledge_bases: KB names to use for RAG.
        attachments: Images / files sent with the message.
        config_overrides: Per-request config tweaks (e.g. temperature).
        language: UI / response language ("en" | "zh").
        memory_context: Memory text in the latest runtime-context snapshot.
        persona_context: Selected persona's instructions, eagerly injected
            into the system prompt (a persona must shape the voice from the
            first token; empty when no persona is active).
        sidebar_context: High-priority grounding for an isolated sidebar tutor
            (for example, the exact passage selected in another chat).
        skills_manifest: System-prompt Skills block — one line per
            capability skill visible to this user, plus any ``always``
            skills' full bodies. The model pulls full skill content on
            demand via the ``read_skill`` tool.
        source_manifest: Plain-text manifest of attached sources (one line per
            source: id/name/type/preview). Empty when no sources are attached.
            Consumed by the chat capability to render an "Attached Sources"
            section in runtime context and to enable the ``read_source`` tool.
        runtime: Private, non-serializable callbacks and provider state.
        interaction: Mutable user/loop interaction state.
        capability_output: Structured terminal capability output.
        extension_state: Per-extension namespaces for mutable plugin state.
        metadata: Serializable compatibility metadata. New mutable extension
            state must use ``extension_state`` instead.
