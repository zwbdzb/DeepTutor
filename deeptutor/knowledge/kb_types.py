"""Knowledge-base kind discriminators.

A KB entry's ``type`` field tells the rest of the system how to treat it.
Most KBs are the default *indexed* kind (chunk → embed → retrieve via an RAG
provider) and carry no ``type``. *Connected* KBs are pointers: their content
lives outside ``data/knowledge_bases`` and we never copy or re-index it. These
flavours exist today:

* ``obsidian`` — a pointer (``vault_path``) to a folder of Markdown the user
  owns. No index at all; the Obsidian capability navigates the live files and
  the chat loop routes the KB to that capability instead of ``rag``.
* ``linked`` — a pointer (``external_path``) to a folder that already holds an
  engine index the user built elsewhere (LlamaIndex / GraphRAG / LightRAG).
  Retrieval reads that index in place — the indexing step is skipped, and the
  KB is queried by its bound ``rag_provider`` exactly like an ordinary KB.
* ``subagent`` — a pointer to a connected agent the capability drives live
  through the ``consult_subagent`` tool. ``agent_kind`` names the backend: a
  *local* CLI (Claude Code / Codex), keyed by an optional ``cwd``; or a
  ``partner`` (one of the user's own partners), keyed by ``partner_id``. It has
  no path on disk and nothing to index or retrieve. See ``capabilities/subagent``.
* ``lightrag_server`` — a pointer (``server_url`` + optional ``api_key``) to an
  external, standalone LightRAG server the user already runs and indexed. We
  never index or store anything locally: retrieval is offloaded to that server's
  ``/query`` endpoint and the bound ``rag_provider`` (``lightrag-server``) shapes
  the result for the ``rag`` tool. One server instance = one workspace = one KB.
  See ``services/rag/pipelines/lightrag_server``.
* ``ima`` — a pointer (``client_id`` + ``api_key`` + ``knowledge_base_id``) to a
  knowledge base the user keeps in Tencent IMA. Same shape as
  ``lightrag_server``: nothing indexed or stored locally, retrieval offloaded to
  IMA's ``search_knowledge`` OpenAPI by the bound ``ima`` provider, and one IMA
  library = one KB. See ``services/rag/pipelines/ima``.
* ``weknora`` — a pointer (``server_url`` + ``api_key`` +
  ``knowledge_base_id``) to a knowledge base the user curates in a
  self-hosted Tencent WeKnora deployment. Retrieval is offloaded to WeKnora's
  knowledge-search API by the bound ``weknora`` provider; no documents are
  copied or indexed locally. See ``services/rag/pipelines/weknora``.
* ``kiwix`` — a pointer (``server_url`` + ``zim_name``) to one searchable ZIM
  served by kiwix-serve. Retrieval reads matched articles over its public HTTP
  API; DeepTutor neither copies the archive nor builds a second index.

All connected flavours share the same lifecycle quirks: no on-disk folder under
``base_dir``, no embedding reconcile, and deletion must never touch the
external resource. The :func:`is_connected_kb` / :func:`external_root_of` helpers
let the manager treat them uniformly without sprinkling ``type`` literals
across the codebase. ``subagent``, ``lightrag_server``, ``ima``, ``weknora`` and
``kiwix`` are connected
but point at no folder, so :func:`external_root_of` returns ``None`` for them — a
subagent is driven by its capability and the two server-backed kinds are reached
over HTTP; none resolves to a local path.

Kept in its own low-level module so both :mod:`deeptutor.knowledge.manager`
and the capability layer can import it without a cycle.
