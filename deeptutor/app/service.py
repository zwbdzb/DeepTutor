    # which ``SessionTitleService`` emits once the answer is saved so the
    # composer and the duration clock stop immediately rather than waiting on
    # the title model. Both loops below used to ``return`` the instant they
    # saw DONE, so every post-DONE event was dropped: the title landed in
    # ``turn_events`` and in the database while no subscriber ever received
    # it, which is why a finished conversation could sit on "New conversation"
    # indefinitely. The frontend even holds its socket open for 15s waiting
    # for that frame; it never had a chance to arrive.
    #
    # End of stream is the turn's lease disappearing, not a timeout.
    #
    # The turn task releases its lease in its own ``finally``, which runs after
    # every post-turn event has been published. So "lease gone" is an honest
    # end-of-stream signal and needs no guessing about how long a title model
    # might take — an idle timeout would have to exceed that model's own 20s
    # ceiling to be safe, and would then hold every finished stream open for
    # 20s whenever no title was written at all.

        is alive and catastrophic once one is not: a single row left behind by
        a lost worker or a restart blocks *every* later message, with no way
        out from the UI (#1297, #1359). Users reported exactly that — one
        window, no refresh, and a conversation that never accepts another word.

        Liveness is the lease, never the row's age: a turn parked on an
        ``ask_user`` card emits no events, so ``updated_at`` stops advancing
        while it legitimately waits for a person to type. A sweep on age would

        seconds whether or not it is producing output, so "no lease" is the one
        signal that separates a zombie from a slow human.

        Doing it here rather than on a timer is what makes it safe: the only
        rows ever considered are ones already blocking a real request, so
