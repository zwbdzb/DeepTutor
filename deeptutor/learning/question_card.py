"""How a mastery question is put in front of the learner.

A mastery question is not a clarifying question. It is a graded artefact: it
has an objective it is testing, a stable id the gate is keyed on, an expected
answer held server-side, a difficulty, and a place in a run of attempts on the
same objective. ``ask_user`` — the generic "I am blocked, decide this for me"
card — carries none of that, so posing a mastery question through it meant
translating the question into a shape that could not hold it, and asking the
model to keep the two in sync by hand.

The tutor now poses the question in one call and this module owns the shape it
travels in, which is the point: the card the learner sees is derived from the
persisted question rather than re-stated alongside it, so the two cannot drift.

That shape is this course's own, on its own event key
(:data:`QUESTION_CARD_KEY`). It used to *also* satisfy the ``ask_user``
structural contract, because the pause/resume machinery and the answer
substitution were written against it — but a posed question no longer pauses
its turn (the answer arrives as the next message, on ``mastery_answer``), so
nothing on the answer path reads that contract any more. What was left was a
card riding a channel meant for something else, marked with a ``kind`` every
reader had to branch on — and the one reader that forgot to branch left every
composer convinced the learner owed a same-turn reply. Cards posed before this
change still carry the old shape, so the surfaces that read them keep a path
for it.
