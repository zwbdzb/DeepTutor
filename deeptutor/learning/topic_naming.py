"""Name a mastery goal from what the learner asked for.

Creating a goal used to take a name as its own field, and dropping that field
left the name derived by truncation: "我想学习有关时间序列神经网络的一切" became
the title, the subtitle, and the sidebar entry — the same sentence three times,
none of them a name.

A name is a different object from a goal. The goal is a sentence about what the
learner wants; the name is the short label they will pick out of a list months
later. Turning one into the other is exactly the kind of small, frequent,
nobody-asked-for-it call the task model exists to serve — the same class as
conversation titles and starter lines.

Never blocks creation. The call is made once, under a short timeout, and any
failure falls back to the truncated goal — which is what the name was before
this module existed, so the worst case is the previous behaviour rather than a
goal that could not be created.
