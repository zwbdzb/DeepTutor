    A configured credential became ``str | list[str]`` when key rotation

    client built once, a pipeline handed a credential. Passing the list
    through would render as ``"['sk-a', 'sk-b']"`` in an ``Authorization``
    header — a 401 whose cause is invisible. Reduce at the boundary instead,
    and reduce in one place so every such boundary agrees which key is first.

    An empty key is not a key, in either shape: ``""``, ``[]`` and ``[""]``
    all answer ``None``, so a caller can test the result rather than having
    to know which spelling the configuration happened to use.
