"""Starter suggestions — the three lines offered under the home composer.

What makes one of these worth showing is a jump, not a summary. The material
is a set of traces — a session titled "Agentic RAG retrieval flow", a quiz
question, a knowledge-base search. Restating a trace ("接着讲 Agentic RAG 的检索
流程") proposes nothing: the learner already knows they were there. Naming a
field ("探索一下检索") proposes nothing either. What earns the click is the
specific thing about that subject worth understanding next — "Agentic RAG 和
naive RAG 的检索差在哪". Same root, one step further.

So ``label`` is that proposal, and it names an idea, a distinction, a
mechanism or a question — never an activity. ``prompt`` is what gets *sent as
the learner's own message* when they click, so it is first-person, complete,
and pointed enough that answering it teaches something.

The jump has a floor: every proposal must be traceable to the material. One
step beyond what a trace literally says is the point; a subject with no root in
it is invention, and invention is worse than silence here.

Never on the request path
-------------------------
An LLM call is far too slow to sit between a click and a rendered page. So
reads are stale-while-revalidate: :func:`get_suggestions` returns whatever is
cached immediately — even if stale, even if empty — and schedules the work
behind the response. The next visit gets the new set.

Reading the cache is the *only* thing that happens synchronously: one small
JSON file. Deciding whether the material changed means walking seven surfaces,
which is cheap but not free, so that decision lives in the background task
too, throttled to at most once a minute per user.

When it regenerates
-------------------
The background pass regenerates when the material changed (a fingerprint over
the labels) or when the set is older than :data:`_TTL_SECONDS` — the first is
when the *content* should change, the second is so the same three lines do not
greet someone all week. A manual refresh bypasses both and generates
synchronously, because there a human is deliberately waiting.

Empty is a valid answer. A learner with no usable history gets no lines and no
LLM call, and the frontend renders nothing at all — generic copy in that slot
would teach people to stop reading it. But empty is only *cached* when it is
the right answer: an empty result produced despite having material is a
failure, and writing it would pin that failure in place for a whole TTL.

You are given traces of what they have been working on — conversations, practice questions, searches, documents. Your job is to see the *subject* behind those traces and name something specific about it that is worth understanding.

Each proposal is an object with two fields:
- "label": the line they read. 4 to 10 words, no ending punctuation. It names a specific idea, distinction, mechanism or question — never an activity.
- "prompt": the message sent as the learner's own words when they click. First person, complete, and pointed enough that a good answer teaches them something.

The move you are making, in one example:
  Trace: [conversation, 2d ago] Agentic RAG retrieval flow
  GOOD: "How agentic RAG differs from naive RAG"
  BAD:  "Continue the Agentic RAG conversation"  <- restates the trace; proposes nothing to understand
  BAD:  "Explore retrieval"                      <- names a field, not a question

Other good shapes: "Why the chain rule underlies backpropagation" / "Where self-attention beats a plain RNN" / "What an eigenvalue actually measures" / "When BM25 still beats embeddings"

Rules:
- Reply with ONLY a JSON array of exactly 3 such objects. No prose, no markdown fence.
- Every proposal must be traceable to the material below. Going one step beyond what it literally says is the point — but never introduce a subject with no root in it.
- The material is raw activity and some of it is noise: a scratch file, a one-word search, a conversation that went nowhere. Skip those and build on the traces that carry a real subject. Three proposals from two good traces beat three that include one about "hello".
- Make the three differ: different subjects from the material, and different kinds of question (a distinction, a mechanism, a why, a boundary case).
- No greetings, no emoji, no quotes around the fields' text."""
