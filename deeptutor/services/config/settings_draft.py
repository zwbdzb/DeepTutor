"""Unapplied settings, held off the runtime path.

Settings offers two promises — "Save Draft" and "Apply" — and until now they
were the same write: both persisted to the live files and both invalidated the
runtime caches, so the only thing distinguishing them was their labels. Worse,
"Save Draft" only ever wrote the model catalog, while half the settings pages
(memory, starting points, network, attachments, document parsing) keep their
state outside it. Editing one of those, pressing Save Draft and reading
"Draft saved" persisted nothing at all, and navigating away lost the edit.

So a draft is now a real place: one envelope, stored beside the live settings
but read by nothing except this module. Apply is what moves it into the files
the runtime resolves against, and clears it.

    Save Draft  → envelope written, runtime untouched
    Apply       → live files written, envelope cleared

The envelope holds the whole catalog and an opaque payload per settings page
that owns state outside it, keyed by the same string the page registers with.
Payloads are opaque on purpose: the pages that produce them are the only code
that understands them, and inventing a server-side schema for each one would
buy validation at the cost of a second definition to keep in sync.
