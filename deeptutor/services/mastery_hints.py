"""Ask-hints — the line the study composer shows before the learner types.

The placeholder used to be ``Ask your tutor about "<waypoint>"…``, which is the
third time that waypoint's name appears on the screen and proposes nothing. A
learner who is stuck is stuck on *what to ask*, and a template cannot help with
that because it does not know what was just said.

So the line is written, per waypoint, by the task model: one question the
learner could ask right now, in their own voice, that the tutor's last message
did not already answer.

It is a question, never an answer
---------------------------------
The single hard rule. This runs on a mastery path, where the whole product
premise is that the learner produces the understanding. A hint that leaks the
answer ("Because the router picks the tool from the intent…") removes the work
the path exists to make them do. The system prompt says so, and
:func:`_sanitize` drops anything that does not end in a question mark.

Never blocks anything
---------------------
The composer is fully usable while this is in flight — the static placeholder
stands until a hint arrives, and a failure just means it keeps standing. So the
call is made synchronously under a short timeout rather than through a
stale-while-revalidate cache: nothing on screen is waiting for it, and a hint
that arrives two seconds late is still the first thing the learner reads.

What is cached is the *result*, keyed on the conversation's own position
(:func:`_cache_key`) — the path, the waypoint, and how far the transcript has
got. Remounting the study screen, toggling the outline or switching tabs all
land on the same key and cost nothing; sending a message moves it, which is
exactly when a new question is worth writing.

You are given where they are on a mastery path and the tail of their conversation. Write the question they would ask next if they knew what to ask.

Hard rule: you write the QUESTION, never the answer. No explanation, no hint at the answer, no "because". If your line teaches the point, it is wrong — the learner is supposed to work that out with the tutor.

Rules:
- Reply with the question alone. No quotes, no prefix, no markdown, no trailing commentary.
- First person, as the learner would type it. Under 14 words.
- End with a question mark.
- It must be about the current waypoint, and it must not ask something the tutor's last message already answered.
- Prefer the question that opens the point up: a distinction, a why, a boundary case, a "what happens if". Avoid yes/no questions and avoid asking for a definition the conversation already gave.

Good: "Why does the router need the intent and not just the query?"
Good: "What breaks if I skip the reflection step?"
