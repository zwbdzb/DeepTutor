"""
Network guards for remote MCP servers (SSRF protection).

Two postures, because the two kinds of server carry different trust:

**Deployment servers** (an administrator's ``mcp.json``) keep the original,
permissive rules. A self-hosted deployment legitimately runs MCP servers on
localhost or its own LAN, and the administrator already has host access, so the
guard only has to stop *accidental* dangerous targets: link-local /
cloud-metadata ranges (169.254.0.0/16 — 169.254.169.254 is the classic
credential-theft target — and fe80::/10) plus the 0.0.0.0/8 "this network"
range.

**Self-service servers** (a user's own, ``strict=True``) additionally lose
loopback and private ranges. The request is made by the *app process*, which
holds every provider API key and shares a network with PocketBase and the
sandbox runner; a URL a user supplies must not be able to aim it inward. An explicit
``allow_private_network`` selection can use RFC1918 addresses only for an
origin approved in the administrator-owned registry; metadata and loopback
remain blocked for self-service callers. This
is what makes per-user MCP configuration safe to offer at all.

Validation is deliberately re-run at connect time, not only when a server is
saved: a check that happens once at save time is defeated by a DNS record that
changes afterwards.
