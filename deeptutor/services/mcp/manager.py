"""
MCP connection manager
======================

App-level singleton that owns the lifecycle of every configured MCP server
connection and exposes their tools as chat :class:`BaseTool` adapters.

Lifecycle model
---------------

DeepTutor's chat runs as per-turn tasks inside one event loop, while MCP
sessions must be opened and closed inside the same task (the SDK's anyio
cancel scopes are task-bound). Each server therefore gets a dedicated
*connection task* that owns its ``AsyncExitStack`` end-to-end::

    connect → enter transports/session in the task → publish adapters →
    wait on a shutdown event → exit the stack in the same task

``ensure_started()`` is lazy (first turn pays the connect cost, capped by a
per-server timeout) and cheap afterwards. ``reload()`` diffs the persisted
config against live connections and only restarts servers whose
configuration actually changed.

Tool adapters are flagged ``deferred`` — their schemas reach the model via
the ``load_tools`` progressive-disclosure flow, not the initial tool list —
and are synced into the global :class:`ToolRegistry` so the regular dispatch
path executes them.
