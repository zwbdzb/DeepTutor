"""Generated-file attachments carried by a turn's stream events.

The unified ``exec`` and media tools write files into the turn workspace and
report their logical paths. ``workspace_present`` then publishes an immutable
workspace item in its tool result and the loop's final SOURCES event. Legacy
non-workspace artifact events remain readable for older stored sessions.

Persisting them as assistant-message attachments is what lets the chat UI
render openable cards (same Viewer path as user uploads) and list them in the
session activity panel, instead of relying on the model pasting a raw
``/files/outputs`` URL into its answer.
