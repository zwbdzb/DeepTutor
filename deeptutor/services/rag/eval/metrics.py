"""Rank-aware retrieval metrics for knowledge-base evaluation.

Every metric is computed at a rank cutoff ``k`` from the *hits* a case produced:
``hits[i]`` is the set of gold-passage indices the chunk at rank ``i + 1`` covers
(see :mod:`deeptutor.services.rag.eval.matching`). Working from a set per rank —
rather than a single relevant/irrelevant flag — is what lets Recall count each
gold passage once even when two chunks quote it, and lets MAP credit the rank at
which each *new* passage first appears.

No metric here calls a model: they are pure functions over rankings, so a score
is reproducible from a stored report and cannot drift with a judge's sampling.
