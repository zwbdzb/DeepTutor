"""Request-local ownership for a human's interaction with a Partner.

Partner configuration and knowledge assets are shared, admin-managed resources.
Conversation history and learned preferences are relationship state, however,
and must follow the authenticated human rather than the process-wide Partner.
This module keeps that distinction in one place and exposes it to Partner-only
tools through a ContextVar that is safe across concurrent async turns.
