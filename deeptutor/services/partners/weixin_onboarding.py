"""Run the personal-WeChat QR login from the web app instead of the terminal.

Configuring a WeChat partner used to mean starting it and then finding the QR
code the channel printed to stdout — which on a container deployment is a
supervisord log the admin has no access to, so the channel's own "scan the QR
code to authenticate" was un-followable (#951).

This drives the same exchange (:mod:`deeptutor.partners.channels.weixin_qr`) on
behalf of a browser: start an attempt, poll it, and on success write the bot
token straight into the partner's channel config.

Two properties this owes the caller:

* **The token never leaves the server.** A status reply says *whether* the login
  succeeded, never what it produced. It is written to the partner config, which
  is already where channel secrets live and is already masked on read.
* **Attempts expire.** Sessions are in-process and short-lived, so a browser tab
  left open overnight cannot hold a pending login, and a restarted backend
  simply has none — the admin starts a new scan, which is what they would do
  anyway.
