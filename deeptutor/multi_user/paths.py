"""Path resolution for admin-local and per-user workspaces.

Everything lives under ``<runtime-home>/data`` so a deployment has exactly
one tree to mount and back up:

* ``data/user``           — the admin workspace (admin scope root is ``data/``)
* ``data/users/<uid>``    — one workspace per non-admin user
* ``data/partners/<id>``  — partner (synthetic-user) workspaces
* ``data/system``         — deployment state: accounts, grants, audit, and the
  per-owner secrets of :func:`get_owner_secrets_dir`. Never mounted into the
  sandbox runner — see ``docker-compose.yml``.

Deployments upgraded from the sibling ``multi-user/`` layout are migrated
in place by :func:`migrate_legacy_multi_user_tree`.
