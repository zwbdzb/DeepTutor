"""Owner-bound LLM profiles an ordinary user signed in for themselves.

An owner-bound profile — an OpenAI Codex OAuth login, today — authenticates
one *person's* subscription rather than a billable team key, so it is never
lent to another account through grants (see
:func:`~deeptutor.multi_user.model_access.is_owner_bound`). Before this
module that left ordinary users with no path to Codex at all: they could
not be granted the administrator's profile (correctly withheld) and could
not sign in for themselves either, because the OAuth endpoints were
admin-only (#781).

The rule that makes per-user sign-in safe is *where the profile lives*: an
ordinary user's Codex profile is written to that user's OWN catalog
(``data/users/<uid>/settings/model_catalog.json``), never into the shared
admin catalog. Nothing an ordinary user does can therefore appear in the
administrator's model list, in another user's options, or in the grant
editor. The profile is merged into the catalog the runtime resolves against
per request instead — which is safe because a managed Codex profile carries
no secret at all (``api_key`` is empty; the token is read from the owner's
credential store at call time by
:class:`~deeptutor.services.llm.provider_core.openai_codex_provider.OpenAICodexProvider`).

Ownership resolution is shared with the credential store via
:func:`~deeptutor.multi_user.paths.get_owner_path_service`, so a profile and
the token that authorizes it can never be resolved to different accounts —
and a partner turn keeps inheriting the login of the human who owns it.
