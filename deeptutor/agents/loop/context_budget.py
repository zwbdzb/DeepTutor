"""Per-turn accounting of what the chat loop put in the model's context window.

The composer surfaces "how full is the window, and what is filling it". Those
numbers only mean something if they describe the request the provider actually
received, so everything here measures *already-assembled* material — the
:class:`PromptBlock` list that produced the system prompt string, the tool
schemas that went into the call kwargs, and the final call's message list.
Re-deriving any of it would let the readout drift from what was sent.

The public entry point never raises: a context readout is an informational
extra and must never sink a turn.
