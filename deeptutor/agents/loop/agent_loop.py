"""Single-loop chat agent.

One chat turn = ONE agent loop over a single growing conversation:

* each round is one LLM call; its text streams to the user as a ``content``
  block, and its tool calls are dispatched with their ``role=tool`` results
  appended back into the conversation;
* every round's text is part of the answer, in the order it was written. A
  round that DOES call tools has written *commentary* — what it is about to do
  and why — and the loop continues; the reader keeps that text, with the tool
  work rendered inline beneath it, the way a terminal agent reads;
* a round that calls NO tools is the ``finish``: its text closes the answer and
  the loop ends (the model deciding it is done; a first round without tool
  calls is the "no exploration needed" fast path);
* if the exploration budget runs out while work is still in protocol, a
  small bounded settlement phase keeps tools available for already-started
  follow-up (including user input); one final tool-less round is forced only
  after that settlement allowance is exhausted.

``ask_user`` pauses the turn for a reply and resumes in-protocol; an
unresolved pause (or a terminator tool) halts the turn.

There is no separate respond pass and no text destination has to be guessed:
every round's text streams to the user as it is generated and stays there. The
``call_status`` marker a completed round emits carries two independent facts —
``call_role`` (``narration`` = more work follows, ``finish`` = terminal) says
where the turn is, while ``answer_visible`` says whether the text counts as
answer content. It is ``True`` for every ordinary round; only a capability
retracting a rejected round sets it ``False``.
