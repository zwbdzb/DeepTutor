"""Per-turn tool composition policy shared by chat / quiz pipelines.

Owns the rule "given the user's composer toggles + the turn's context
flags, what tools should be enabled?". Lives outside any single pipeline
so chat and quiz can't disagree about which tools the user controls vs.
which the pipeline auto-mounts.

Two pieces:

* :data:`AUTO_MOUNTED_TOOLS` — tools whose mounting is owned by the
  pipeline (auto-on under specific conditions), not by user toggles.
  Membership here hides the tool from the user's composer / settings UI.
* :func:`compose_enabled_tools` — pure function that takes the user's
  toggled list + a :class:`ToolMountFlags` and returns the final, ordered
  enabled-tool list for one turn.

Callers resolve their own flags (chat checks selected KBs / source index
/ memory / notebooks; quiz reuses chat's policy verbatim).

    Order:

    1. User-toggled tools (filtered through ``get_enabled`` so unknown tools
       never sneak in, intersected with ``optional_whitelist`` so only
       legitimate composer toggles are respected).
    2. Conditional auto-mounts (:data:`_CONDITIONAL_MOUNT_FLAGS`: ``rag`` if a
       KB is attached, ``read_source`` if a source index exists, …).
    3. Active loop capabilities' *owned* tools (``capability_owned``) — the
       capability's own tools, added on top.
    4. Always-on auto-mounts (``write_memory`` / ``web_fetch`` / ``github`` /
       ``ask_user`` / ``cron``).

    A loop capability (solve, mastery) reuses the *full* chat surface and only
    *adds* its owned tools — it never curates or suppresses the reused
    built-ins, so a capability turn respects the user's composer toggles
    exactly as a chat turn does.

    ``exclusive=True`` flips that for the *knowledge* category (an active
    :class:`~deeptutor.capabilities.protocol.KnowledgeCapability`): the turn
    runs on ``capability_owned`` plus the ``ask_user`` floor — no other
    built-ins, no composer toggles. The one exception is ``rag`` when
    ``mount_flags.has_kb`` is set: it serves co-selected KBs the capability does
    not own (e.g. LlamaIndex KBs alongside an Obsidian vault), so it coexists
    with the owned surface instead of being dropped (issue #650). The capability
    otherwise owns the surface.

    ``builtin_whitelist`` gates the *built-in* auto-mounts (steps 2 and 4 —
    the :data:`AUTO_MOUNTED_TOOLS` members). ``None`` (the product-chat default)
    means "no gating": every built-in mounts under its usual context condition,
    exactly as before. A set restricts which built-ins may mount — partners use
    this so an owner can deny e.g. ``read_memory`` to an IM-facing companion.
    It never *adds* tools (a built-in still needs its context gate); it only
    subtracts. User-toggled tools (step 1) and capability-owned tools (step 3)
    are unaffected — they have their own gates.

    ``forced`` tools are appended unconditionally — they bypass both the
    ``builtin_whitelist`` and the context gates (used by the partner runtime to
    mandate ``partner_read`` / ``partner_memorize`` / ``partner_search``).
    ``suppressed`` tools are removed from the final list regardless of how they
    got there (the partner runtime suppresses chat's ``read_memory`` /
    ``write_memory`` in favour of the partner variants). Both apply in the
    ``exclusive`` branch too.

    The result is ordered and deduplicated. ``optional_whitelist`` is still
    expected to exclude ``AUTO_MOUNTED_TOOLS`` via :func:`default_optional_tools`.
