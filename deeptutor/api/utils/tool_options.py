"""Configurable-tool surface shared by the partners and multi-user admin APIs.

``tools`` mirrors the user-toggleable system tools (the same pool the chat
composer / settings expose); ``builtin_tools`` lists the auto-mounted built-in
tools (rag / read_memory / web_fetch / …) a partner owner can selectively
allow or deny; ``mcp_tools`` lists every configured MCP tool that a whitelist
(partner config or user grant) could allow.

Each ``mcp_tools`` row carries its provider identity — ``kind`` (``"mcp"``
today) and ``provider_id`` (the server name) — so the pickers can fold
hundreds of tools into one row per service. ``server`` is the pre-provider
spelling of ``provider_id`` and stays populated for existing clients.
