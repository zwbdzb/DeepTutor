# ============================================
# DeepTutor Multi-Stage Dockerfile
# ============================================
# This Dockerfile builds a production-ready image for DeepTutor
# containing both the FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend
#
# Build/run:
#   docker build -t deeptutor:local .
#   docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3782:3782 -p 127.0.0.1:8001:8001 \
#     -v deeptutor-data:/app/data deeptutor:local
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. Runtime settings are created under data/user/settings on first start
#   2. Configure provider profiles from the web Settings page or model_catalog.json
# ============================================

# ============================================
# Stage 1: Frontend Builder
# ============================================
# Run on the build platform natively (not under QEMU emulation).
# The output is platform-independent static assets (JS/HTML/CSS),
# so there is no need to cross-compile this stage.

# Stage 1b: Node Runtime for Target Platform
# ============================================

# Unlike frontend-builder (pinned to BUILDPLATFORM), this stage pulls
# the node image matching each target platform (amd64 / arm64).

# Unraid/NAS bind mounts owned by a host user other than 1000 stay writable
