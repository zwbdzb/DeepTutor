/**
 * Re-read UI preferences after the assistant changes them from within chat.
 *
 * The browser is the source of truth for language and theme: the app shell
 * reads them from localStorage and only consults the server when localStorage
 * holds nothing at all (see `AppShellContext`). That is right for a person
 * switching languages in one tab, but it means a change the assistant makes
 * on the server is invisible here — the user is told "done" while the
 * interface stays exactly as it was, which reads as a broken promise.
 *
 * So the backend's `apply_setting` tags its result with `setup_applied`, and
 * this hook treats that tag as "your cached copy is stale": it re-reads the
 * server's UI settings once and writes them through the same storage helpers a
 * manual change would use. Those helpers emit the storage events the app shell
 * already listens to, so the whole UI switches over without a reload.
 *
 * Each tool call is honoured once — replayed history and re-renders must not
 * keep overwriting a preference the user has since changed by hand.
