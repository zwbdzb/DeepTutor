/**
 * What the sidebar's history region lists, and in what order.
 *
 * The region used to be three stacked tables — a "Chat" heading over the home
 * conversations, then one heading per mastery topic, then one per reading
 * collection — so a conversation held ten minutes ago sat below headings whose
 * newest conversation was a week old, and the surface you were last working in
 * was never the thing at the top.
 *
 * Here there is one list instead. A home conversation is an entry; a topic or a
 * collection is *also* an entry — a single collapsible unit sitting at the same
 * level as a conversation, ranked by the newest conversation inside it. So the
 * list reads by recency all the way down whatever surface the work happened on,
 * and one hand-arranged order (see ``applyManualOrder``) covers both kinds.
 *
 * Pure and free of React so the ordering can be tested on its own.
