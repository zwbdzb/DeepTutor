/**
 * Reading the mastery navigation tools' hand-off signals off a turn's stream.
 *
 * Chat can address the learner's mastery topics but never teaches them: the
 * study screen owns the map, the lesson outline and the gate, so a request
 * like "take me back through lesson one" is resolved here and *handed over*
 * rather than answered in place. `mastery_open_session` and
 * `mastery_new_session` (see `deeptutor/tools/mastery_nav.py`) emit that
 * hand-off as `mastery_handoff` on a tool result's metadata, and it becomes a
 * card.
 *
 * A card rather than an automatic redirect, for the same reason Course Study
 * uses one (`lib/course-handoff.ts`): a page that changes underneath the
 * learner reads as a malfunction, and the opening line is a proposal they
 * should be able to edit or ignore.
 *
 * Kept as pure functions apart from the component that renders them, so the
 * parsing can be tested without a DOM.
