 * designs the map, study works it forward, review re-tests what is already
 * mastered. The tutor switches with `mastery_mode`; the learner switches by
 * pressing one of the three above the transcript.
 *
 * It is not a label. The server refuses a tool that does not belong to the
 * current mode, so this is what the conversation can actually do — which is
 * why the UI shows all three and marks the live one, rather than naming the
 * current one and leaving the others to be guessed at.
