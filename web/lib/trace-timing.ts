/**
 * Turn-level timing for the chat status header.
 *
 * Each assistant turn used to surface a duration label on every
 * sub-trace ("Plan for 5s", "Round 3 · 8s", …). That made the
 * trace card noisy and made it hard to tell at a glance how long
 * the whole answer took. The current design hoists timing to the
 * single ``DeepTutor reasoning…`` status row at the top of the
 * answer: one number, ticking up while the turn is in flight and
 * frozen once the turn is done.
 *
 * The clock derives its bounds from the event stream so reconnects
 * keep the duration coherent — we never depend on a transient React
 * state that resets on remount.
 */

import type { StreamEvent } from "@/features/chat/model/protocol";

/**
 * Elapsed seconds for the turn the ``events`` belong to.
 *
 * Returns ``null`` when neither events nor submission bounds provide a
 * timestamp. Optimistic messages carry their submission time so connection
 * and provider latency are visible before the first server frame (#1435).
 *
 * While ``isStreaming`` is true the upper bound floats to
 * ``nowSeconds`` so the label ticks up in real time; once streaming
 * ends the bound collapses to the latest event timestamp and the
 * duration freezes.
 *
 * ``bounds`` carries the turn's real span when the caller has it. A persisted
 * turn arrives as a *preview* — only its tool and terminal events survive —
 * and the events that mark where the turn began are never among them. Timing
 * the preview alone therefore starts the clock at the first tool call and
 * discards however long the model spent thinking beforehand. A round that
 * thinks and then answers in a single burst has its entire duration in that
 * discarded span, and rendered as ``0s``.
