/**
 * Single place pdf.js is loaded and configured.
 *
 * The library and its worker are ~1.5 MB together, so they are imported
 * dynamically: a user who never opens the reader never downloads them. The
 * promise is memoised, so the many pages of one document share one module
 * instance and one worker.
 *
 * The worker URL is built with `new URL(..., import.meta.url)` rather than a
 * hand-written public path, which lets the bundler fingerprint and serve the
 * worker file itself — a hard-coded `/pdf.worker.mjs` would have to be copied
 * into `public/` by a build step and would break the moment the version bumps.
 *
 * Both the library and its worker use the `legacy` build. The default worker
 * calls newer ECMAScript methods such as `Map.prototype.getOrInsertComputed`
 * that are absent in some supported browsers and embedded webviews. There,
 * the worker can fail with
 *
 *   this._requestsByChunk.getOrInsertComputed is not a function
 *
 * and the document never renders — silently, since the failure happens in the
 * worker. The legacy worker includes core-js polyfills for those methods. The
 * extra code is loaded only when a user opens a PDF.
