/**
 * Reading a mastery question — and its verdict — out of a turn's events.
 *
 * A mastery question is graded work, not a clarifying question: it names the
 * objective it is testing, it is the Nth attempt at that objective, it has a
 * difficulty, and it ends in a ruling with an explanation. So it travels on
 * its own tool-metadata key, `mastery_question`, and this module is the only
 * place that knows its shape — the generic `ask_user` card and everything
 * written against it are a different thing entirely.
 *
 * It used to ride the `ask_user` channel, marked with a `kind` every reader
 * had to branch on. Questions posed before that changed are still in the
 * history, so `readPosedQuestion` also reads the old envelope.
 *
 * The verdict arrives separately, on the `mastery_grade` tool result — often a
 * round later than the question. Indexing it by question id here is what lets
 * the card that asked show the answer, rather than leaving the learner to find
 * it in the prose below.
