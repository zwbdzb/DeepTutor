 * doing next, and hands the learner to the surface that actually does it — with
 * the opening message already written. That hand-off arrives as
 * `course_handoff` on a tool result's metadata and becomes a card.
 *
 * A card rather than an automatic redirect on purpose: the learner may still be
 * reading the paragraph that explains *why*, and a page that changes underneath
 * them reads as a malfunction. The card also makes the reasoning inspectable
 * and the suggestion refusable.
 *
 * Mirrors the metadata written by `deeptutor/capabilities/course_study/tools.py`.
 * Kept as pure functions, apart from the component that renders them, for the
 * same reason `lib/setup-signals.ts` is.
