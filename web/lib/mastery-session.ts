/**
 * Which surface a conversation belongs to — the one place that decides.
 *
 * A mastery study conversation is an ordinary chat session that happens to
 * carry `mastery_path_id` in its preferences. Two surfaces need to read that:
 * the sidebar, to file the conversation under its topic, and the click
 * handler, to open it on its topic session route instead of `/chat`.
 * If those two ever disagreed, a conversation would render under a topic and
 * then navigate somewhere else — so the rule lives here and neither owns it.
 *
 * Workspace mode and path id are both required. The capability is a per-turn
 * action (Chat, Quiz, Research, ...), so it never decides which product
 * surface owns the conversation.
 *
 * Immersive Reading conversations answer the same question with their own
 * pair of signals, and land on their collection instead. They are here rather
 * than in a second module for the reason above: if two places decided where a
 * conversation lives, the sidebar would file one under a heading and then
 * navigate somewhere else.
