/**
 * The activity vocabulary: how DeepTutor shows work in progress.
 *
 * Every surface that reports ongoing work — chat's reasoning trace, a book
 * compile, a co-writer run, deep research, the sidebar's live sessions —
 * composes these four pieces rather than growing its own spinner:
 *
 *   ActivityHeader   an orb + what is happening + how long
 *   ActivityStack    the rows under it, aligned to the orb's column
 *   ActivityDivider  a labelled break between groups of rows
 *   ActivityRow      one action, with its specifics folded away
 *   ActivityFold     the content a header folds away, on the shared curve
 *   ActivityDetailGrid  the label/value layout inside level two
 *   ActivityMark     a list row's mark, for lists with no header orb above
 *
 * The contract is two levels. Level one is what a reader sees having clicked
 * nothing: one line per action. Level two is everything else. Nothing opens
 * itself except work the reader is meant to watch happen, which folds itself
 * away once it settles.
