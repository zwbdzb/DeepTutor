/**
 * What this course is waiting for, decided from its own numbers.
 *
 * The course page should answer "what now?" before the learner has to ask, and
 * without spending a model round to find out: the state aggregate already knows
 * where the errors cluster, which module stalled, and what is half-read. So the
 * suggestion here is deterministic — the same evidence Course Study reads,
 * turned into one concrete move.
 *
 * Course Study remains the place for judgement (it can weigh the syllabus, ask
 * why the learner is stuck, and change its mind). This panel is the floor: even
 * with the tutor closed, opening a course tells you where you stand.
 *
 * Each action carries its opening line through `setPendingPrompt`, so taking it
 * lands in the destination already asking the right question — the same
 * hand-off contract the tutor's cards use.
