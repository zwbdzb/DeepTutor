/**
 * The three things worth exploring next, under the home composer.
 *
 * Each line shows its ``label`` — a specific thing worth understanding, drawn
 * from what this learner has actually been working on — and sends its
 * ``prompt`` as their own message, so a click starts a real conversation
 * rather than prefilling something they still have to finish. Generation,
 * caching and staleness live on the backend; this renders the result, and owns
 * the manual way back when there is nothing to render.
 *
 * There is no generic fallback copy: the value of these lines is that they are
 * about *this* learner's material, and filler in the same slot would teach
 * people to stop reading it. But "no lines" is not the same as "no slot" — a
 * cold cache, a model that failed, or an output-language switch that
 * invalidated the cache all leave a visible control that regenerates on
 * demand.
 *
 * One per line, left-aligned to the composer's own edge, with no border or
 * fill: these name specific ideas, and a specific sentence in a pill reads as
 * a tag rather than as an invitation. The arrow carries the invitation
 * instead, and is the only coloured element at rest.
