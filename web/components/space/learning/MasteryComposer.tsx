/**
 * The study screen's composer — the same one the main chat page uses,
 * sending through the unified chat context.
 *
 * A mastery session is a chat session, so the learner gets the whole
 * composer: attachments, `@`-space references, the knowledge picker, the
 * model selector, dictation, and the Skills/MCP narrowing Chat uses. Those
 * last controls are session-scoped rather than per-turn — knowledge bases,
 * the pinned model, and the resource selection — so they are driven
 * straight off the session state instead of a second copy inside the
 * composer.
 *
 * What it does NOT get is the action menu. This screen runs one loop — the
 * tutor — and it used to open on "Chat" instead, which reached the same tutor
 * by a different route (the workspace flag made a chat turn mount the mastery
 * tools). Two entrances to one place, with the visible label naming the wrong
 * one. The action is now the screen itself.
