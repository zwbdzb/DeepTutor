/**
 * The three things a mastery conversation can be doing, with the live one marked.
 *
 * All three are shown, not just the current one. The mode decides which tools
 * the tutor may use, so it is the answer to "why can it not just fix that for
 * me" — and a learner can only ask that question if they can see the other two
 * modes exist. Naming only the current one made the mode look like a status
 * readout instead of a control.
 *
 * The mark is a ring that fills, not an orb. An orb means *DeepTutor is
 * working*; there are two on this screen already (the header's activity line
 * and every assistant turn), and a third one that meant "you are here" would
 * be the same glyph saying two different things. A ring is the same visual
 * family — small, round, drawn in the product's ink — while reading as a
 * position rather than as motion.
