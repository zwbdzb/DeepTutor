 * The square mark in front of a store entry: the product's own logo when we have
 * it, an initials monogram when we do not.
 *
 * Rendered inline from a bundled CC0 path — no image request, so opening the
 * store does not tell a vendor that this person is looking at their service.
 *
 * Monochrome (`currentColor`) rather than the brand's own hex, for two reasons:
 * a dozen brand colours in one grid reads as noise next to DeepTutor's own
 * restrained palette, and several brand hexes fail contrast against one of the
 * two themes. The hex is kept in the generated data if an accent is ever wanted.
