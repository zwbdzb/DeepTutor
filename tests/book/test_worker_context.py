"""Background compilation must not inherit a request's scoped LLM config.

`asyncio.create_task` copies the context it is created in. The book worker is
created inside whichever request first enqueued a page, so a per-run model pick
made by that one request would otherwise pin every chapter the worker compiles
for the rest of its life — invisibly, since generated prose does not say which
model wrote it.
