"""Model-intrinsic request overrides survive a generic binding (issue #938).

Kimi-branded models lock ``temperature`` server-side and answer HTTP 400
``invalid temperature: only 1 is allowed for this model`` to any explicit
value. The ``moonshot`` spec has dropped the parameter for them since before
v1.5.5 — but the override was resolved from the *configured binding*, so it
only fired for someone who had picked ``binding="moonshot"``. #938 picked
``binding="openai"`` and pointed it at Moonshot, which is what most users do
with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and kept getting the 400.

The route is not what enforces the limit, so the route is not what should
decide. These tests pin that, and pin the two things that must keep working:
an explicit binding still wins, and the tunable ``moonshot-v1-*`` series
(which carries no "kimi" in its name) keeps the caller's temperature.
