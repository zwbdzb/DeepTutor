"""Probe/full-read equivalence for the snapshot adapters.

A probe exists to skip reading content. That is only safe while it agrees with
its full adapter about *identity* — id, label and fingerprint — because the two
feed the same diff: a refresh driven by one and a refresh driven by the other
must not disagree about what changed. These tests pin that agreement, including
the case that motivates the probe's odd-looking SQL.
