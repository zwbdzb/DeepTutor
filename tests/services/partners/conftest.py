"""Fixtures for the partners service suite — isolate all paths under tmp_path.

Also holds the scripted-orchestrator scaffolding every runtime-level test
needs: a partner turn is a chat-loop run, and the tests care about what the
runner does with the loop's events, not about the loop itself.

    """Redirect the admin workspace (and multi-user roots) under ``tmp_path``.

    Everything the partners layer touches resolves through
    ``deeptutor.multi_user.paths`` — the partners data dir is anchored at the
    admin workspace root and partner scopes are synthetic ``UserScope``s — so
    patching that module covers the partners layer itself.

    ``identity`` is a second front, and patching ``paths`` does *not* reach it:
    it binds ``AUTH_DIR = SYSTEM_ROOT / "auth"`` at import, so a later
    ``setattr`` on ``paths.SYSTEM_ROOT`` leaves its module-level file constants
    pointing at the real ``data/system/auth/``. Any test that saves a user was
    therefore writing into the developer's own account store, and reading it
    back — which made the outcome depend on who already had an account there,
    since the first account in a store is force-promoted to admin.
