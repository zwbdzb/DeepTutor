# DeepTutor Containerization

This document covers deploying DeepTutor from a container image: the
recommended `docker run` path, the hardened rootless-Podman path with a
read-only root filesystem, runtime configuration, the optional PocketBase
sidecar, and the security notes that motivate the default posture.

For PyPI / source installs, see the main [README.md](../README.md). This
file is only about running the published image.

---

## Overview

The published `ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor` image runs both the FastAPI
backend (`:8001`) and the Next.js frontend (`:3782`) under `supervisord`
inside a single container, on top of `python:3.11-slim`. The private runtime
tree (`/app/data` inside the container) holds settings, credentials, databases,
memory, knowledge bases, and logs. The default Content Workspace also lives
there, but may instead be mounted separately at `/workspace`. Bind-mount the
runtime tree and any separate Content Workspace to make both survive restarts.

The image is built so it works under three deployment shapes:

1. **`docker run`** — the easy path. Rootful, writable rootfs, single
   bind mount on `/app/data`.
2. **`docker compose`** (`docker-compose.yml`) — same image plus the
   PocketBase sidecar and the sandbox-runner sidecar. Still rootful,
   writable rootfs.
3. **`podman compose -f compose.yaml`** — the hardened path. Rootless
   (`userns_mode: keep-id`), read-only rootfs, tmpfs in place of writable
   system dirs, bind mount on `./data`.

The architectural change that makes shape 3 work is that URL knowledge
no longer lives in the frontend bundle. Concretely:

- The bundle is built with no `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` placeholder and no
  `sed -i` of the build output. `web/lib/api.ts` exports `apiUrl` and
  `wsUrl` as one-line pass-throughs, so the browser fetches relative
  paths through the frontend (`:3782/api/...`).
- `web/proxy.ts` catches `/api/*` and `/ws/*` and rewrites them to
  `DEEPTUTOR_API_BASE_URL` at request time. That env var is set by the
  container entrypoint on every start, read from
  `data/user/settings/system.json`.
- `start-frontend.sh` is now 12 lines: it sets `PORT`/`HOSTNAME` and
  `exec`s `node /app/web/server.js`. No mutations of the bundle.
- `supervisord` runs as root (PID 1) and drops each program (backend,
  frontend) to a non-root `deeptutor` user (UID 1000) via its per-program
  `user=` directive, so the app processes stay non-root. With
  `userns_mode: keep-id` on the host that UID maps to your host UID; with a
  regular `docker run` it's a normal unprivileged user inside the container.

The full per-installation guide follows.

---

## Docker (default)

The simplest possible deployment. One container, one private-data volume, and
one port mapping.

```bash
docker run --rm --name deeptutor \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3782:3782 \
  -v deeptutor-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:3782>. The container creates
`/app/data/user/settings/*.json` on first boot; configure model providers
from the Web Settings page. Config, API keys, logs, workspace files,
memory, and knowledge bases persist in the `deeptutor-data` named volume.

### Select a host Content Workspace

The application data mount contains private settings, credentials, databases,
Memory, and other runtime state. Keep that separate from the **Content
Workspace** that agents can read. To expose a host folder, mount it at the
stable `/workspace` path and lock the deployment to that path:

```bash
mkdir -p "$PWD/deeptutor-workspace/outputs"
docker run --rm --name deeptutor \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3782:3782 \
  -v deeptutor-data:/app/data \
  -v "$PWD/deeptutor-workspace:/workspace" \
  -e DEEPTUTOR_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/workspace \
  -e DEEPTUTOR_WORKSPACE_ALLOWED_ROOTS=/workspace \
  ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest
```

For the supplied Compose files:

```bash
DEEPTUTOR_WORKSPACE_HOST=/absolute/host/folder \
  python scripts/docker_compose.py -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The helper creates the host folder and its nested `outputs/` directory before
Compose starts, avoiding root-owned bind mounts. If the variable is omitted,
`./data/user/workspace` is used. The container always sees `/workspace`, so
stored settings and model-facing paths remain portable across hosts. This is a
startup/deployment choice and is shown as locked in **Settings → Workspace**.

With `docker-compose.yml`, the sandbox runner receives the content tree
read-only plus a writable overlay for `/workspace/outputs`; it does not receive
`/app/data`, user settings, or credentials. Generated programs therefore read
the selected content and write only turn-scoped output. The single-container
and rootless-Podman forms use the best isolation backend available in that
container and report the effective level in Workspace settings.

Notes:

- **Only `3782` needs to be published.** The browser talks exclusively to
  the frontend origin (`:3782`); all `/api/*` and `/ws/*` traffic is
  forwarded to the FastAPI backend **inside the container** by the Next.js
  middleware (`web/proxy.ts`), which reads `DEEPTUTOR_API_BASE_URL`
  (`http://localhost:8001` by default) at request time. You do **not** need
  to expose `:8001` to the host for the UI to work. Publishing `:8001`
  (`-p 127.0.0.1:8001:8001`) is optional — handy only for hitting the API
  directly (curl, scripts) or debugging.
- **Different host ports:** change the left side of each `-p host:container`
  mapping (e.g. `-p 127.0.0.1:8088:3782`). If you change container-side
  ports in `data/user/settings/system.json` (`backend_port`,
  `frontend_port`), restart the container and update the right side of
  each mapping to match.
- **Detached:** add `-d`, then `docker logs -f deeptutor` to follow,
  `docker stop deeptutor` to stop, `docker rm deeptutor` before reusing
  the name. The `deeptutor-data` volume keeps private runtime data and the
  default Content Workspace across restarts; a separately mounted Content
  Workspace persists at its host path.

### Temporary local Codex OAuth bridge

OpenAI Codex redirects the browser to fixed loopback ports `1455` or `1457`.
The default container network is separate from the host loopback, so publish
both ports to the Web frontend only while signing in. Both host ports must be
free before starting the temporary bridge.

For `docker run`, stop the normal container and temporarily rerun the same
image and data volume with two extra loopback-only mappings:

```bash
docker run --rm --name deeptutor \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3782:3782 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:1455:3782 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:1457:3782 \
  -v deeptutor-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest
```

For Compose, add the same temporary overlay to the base file you normally use:

```bash
# Source build with sidecars
python scripts/docker_compose.py \
  -f docker-compose.yml -f compose.codex-oauth.yaml \
  up -d --force-recreate deeptutor

# Pre-built GHCR image
python scripts/docker_compose.py \
  -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml -f compose.codex-oauth.yaml \
  up -d --force-recreate deeptutor

# Rootless Podman
podman compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.codex-oauth.yaml \
  up -d --force-recreate deeptutor
```

Complete **Settings → Models → OpenAI Codex → Sign in with Codex**. After the
status changes to **Connected**, stop the temporary `docker run` container and
return to the normal command above. For Compose, rerun the same base command
without `compose.codex-oauth.yaml`; keep `--force-recreate deeptutor` so the
temporary port bindings are removed.

This releases host ports `1455` and `1457`; credentials remain in the persistent
`/app/data/system` tree. Bind every callback mapping to `127.0.0.1` and never
expose it on a LAN or public interface — the overlay publishes the **whole**
frontend on those two ports, not just `/auth/callback`. For a manual
`docker run` whose container-side frontend port is not `3782`, change the
right-hand `3782` targets; `scripts/docker_compose.py` handles configured
custom ports. For single-container installs, set `sandbox_allow_subprocess`
to `false` if model-generated code must not share the container trust
boundary with secrets.

### One-time migration: `docker-compose.ghcr.yml` now mounts all of `./data`

`docker-compose.ghcr.yml` used to bind-mount only three subtrees
(`data/user`, `data/memory`, `data/knowledge_bases`), so everything else —
`data/system` (the JWT signing secret, accounts, grants, audit log, per-owner
Codex tokens), `data/users` (per-user workspaces), `data/partners`,
`data/cli-apps` — lived in the container's writable layer and was discarded
on every recreate. It now mounts the whole tree, matching
`docker-compose.yml` and `compose.yaml`.

**Before your first `up -d` after upgrading**, copy that state out of the
running container, or the empty host directories shadow it and DeepTutor
regenerates the auth secret (logging everyone out) and starts with no
non-admin accounts:

```bash
for tree in system users partners cli-apps; do
  docker cp "deeptutor:/app/data/$tree" "./data/$tree" 2>/dev/null || true
done
```

Deployments using a named volume (`-v deeptutor-data:/app/data`) or the
source-build Compose file were never affected — they already persisted the
whole tree.

### Remote / reverse-proxy deployments

For the common **single-container** case (this image), you do **not** need
to configure an API base at all. The browser issues relative `/api/*` and
`/ws/*` requests against whatever origin serves the UI
(`https://deeptutor.example.com`), and the in-container Next.js middleware
forwards them to the backend on `localhost:8001`. Just point your reverse
proxy / TLS terminator at the published `:3782` and you're done.

You only need to set an API base for a **split deployment** where the
backend runs in a separate container. Edit `data/user/settings/system.json`
on the host (inside the `deeptutor-data` volume — `docker volume inspect
deeptutor-data` to find its mountpoint) and set the in-network address the
frontend container uses to reach the backend container:

```json
{
  "next_public_api_base": "http://backend:8001"
}
```

The entrypoint reads this on every start and exports
`DEEPTUTOR_API_BASE_URL` for `proxy.ts` (precedence: `next_public_api_base`,
then `next_public_api_base_external`, then `http://localhost:8001`). Note
that because the proxy is **server-side**, `DEEPTUTOR_API_BASE_URL` is the
address the frontend *server* uses to reach the backend — not a URL the
browser ever sees. `public_api_base` is accepted as a compatibility alias
and normalized into `next_public_api_base_external` on save.

CORS uses frontend **origins**, not API URLs. With auth disabled,
DeepTutor permits normal HTTP/HTTPS browser origins by default. With
auth enabled, add exact frontend origins:

```json
{
  "cors_origins": ["https://deeptutor.example.com"]
}
```

### Host LLM providers (Ollama / LM Studio / llama.cpp / vLLM / Lemonade)

Inside Docker, `localhost` is the container itself, not your host
machine. To reach a model service running on the host, use the host
gateway (recommended):

```bash
docker run --rm --name deeptutor \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3782:3782 -p 127.0.0.1:8001:8001 \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -v deeptutor-data:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest
```

Then in **Settings → Models**, point the provider Base URL at
`host.docker.internal`:

- Ollama LLM: `http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1`
- Ollama embedding: `http://host.docker.internal:11434/api/embed`
- LM Studio: `http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1`
- llama.cpp: `http://host.docker.internal:8080/v1`
- Lemonade: `http://host.docker.internal:13305/api/v1`

Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) usually resolves `host.docker.internal`
without `--add-host`. On Linux, the flag is the portable way.

**Linux alternative — host networking:** add `--network=host` and drop
the `-p` flags. The container shares the host network directly, so open
<http://127.0.0.1:3782> (or the `frontend_port` in `system.json`), and
host services can be reached with normal localhost URLs.

In host-network mode the processes bind directly on the host interfaces
(there is no `-p 127.0.0.1:` prefix to scope them). To keep them off the
LAN, set `BACKEND_HOST=127.0.0.1` and `FRONTEND_HOST=127.0.0.1` — they
override uvicorn's `--host` and Next.js's `HOSTNAME` (both default to
`0.0.0.0`). Only use these with `--network=host`: in bridge mode binding
to loopback breaks the published `-p` port forward.

---

## Podman / rootless / read-only rootfs

For users who want the strongest default posture — rootless, with a
read-only root filesystem — `compose.yaml` is the supported starting
point. It pulls the same `ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest` image and
relies on the entrypoint chown + supervisord's per-program privilege drop,
the URL-forwarding `proxy.ts`, and host-side bind mounts to make it all work.

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # then edit if needed
podman compose -f compose.yaml up -d
podman compose -f compose.yaml ps
podman compose -f compose.yaml logs -f deeptutor
```

Verify rootless is active (`podman info | grep -i rootless` should
report `true`).

What `compose.yaml` does, and why:

- **`read_only: true` on every service.** The container's rootfs is
  read-only. The only writable surface is the `tmpfs:` mounts listed
  per service plus the bind-mounted `./data` and Content Workspace directories.
- **`userns_mode: keep-id`.** The container's UID 0 maps to your host
  UID; the container's UID 1000 (the `deeptutor` user inside the image)
  maps to your host UID 1000 (which most distros reserve for the first
  human user). The `:U` suffix on every volume mount tells podman to
  chown the bind-mount target to that mapped UID.
- **`tmpfs:` mounts for the system dirs the runtime expects to write.**
  `/tmp` (Python/Node scratch), `/run` and `/var/run` (pidfiles),
  `/var/log`, `/root`, `/home`. Sizes are intentionally generous; trim
  to taste.
- **No named volumes.** Podman auto-creates named volumes with the
  userns-mapped root (UID 100000), so 755 perms + wrong owner =
  `PermissionError` on the first JSON write. Bind mounts on a host
  directory you own work cleanly.
- **Loopback-only port bindings.** `127.0.0.1:` prefix on every `ports:`
  entry. Drop the prefix to expose on all interfaces.
- **No sandbox-runner sidecar.** The `docker-compose.yml` shape includes
  a hardened sidecar that runs untrusted model-generated code in a
  least-privileged container. The podman shape does not — the main app
  falls back to `bwrap` (Linux, if installed in the image) or the
  restricted subprocess backend controlled by
  `sandbox_allow_subprocess` in `system.json`.

### Running outside `compose.yaml`

`compose.yaml` is a starting point, not the only shape. The same
invariants apply if you want to drive `podman run` directly:

```bash
mkdir -p data/user/settings
echo '{}' > data/user/settings/system.json

podman run --rm -d --name deeptutor \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8001:8001 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3782:3782 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data:U \
  --read-only \
  --tmpfs /tmp:size=512m,mode=1777 \
  --tmpfs /run:size=32m,mode=0755 \
  --tmpfs /var/run:size=8m,mode=0755 \
  --tmpfs /var/log:size=64m,mode=0755 \
  --tmpfs /root:size=16m,mode=0700 \
  --tmpfs /home:size=16m,mode=0755 \
  --userns=keep-id \
  ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest
```

After the container is up, the backend and frontend always run as the
non-root `deeptutor` user (UID 1000) — `podman exec deeptutor ps -o user,pid,comm`
shows the `uvicorn`/`node` children as `deeptutor`. `supervisord` itself
(PID 1) runs as whatever UID the runtime started it with: root under rootful
Docker/Podman, or the host user under rootless podman + `userns_mode: keep-id`.

### Supervisord pidfile

The `[supervisord]` section carries **no `user=` directive**, so supervisord
runs as PID 1's UID and never tries to drop its own privilege; only its child
programs are dropped to `deeptutor` via the per-program `user=` directives.
Pinning `user=root` here (an earlier design) broke rootless keep-id, where
PID 1 is the non-root host user and lacks `CAP_SETUID`: supervisord refuses to
drop privilege and exits at startup with `Can't drop privilege as nonroot
user` (see supervisord's `options.py`).

The pidfile is written to **`/tmp/supervisord.pid`**. `/tmp` is `mode=1777`
(world-writable) in every run configuration above, so the pidfile is writable
whether PID 1 is root or the host UID, and regardless of who owns `/var/run`.
An earlier build pointed the pidfile at the root-owned `/var/run/supervisord.pid`;
under rootless keep-id the non-root PID 1 couldn't write it and logged a
cosmetic `CRIT could not write pidfile` on every start. Putting it in `/tmp`
removes that dependency on the `/var/run` owner and mode entirely.

---

## Runtime configuration

Almost everything you tune lives under `data/user/settings/` inside the
data tree. The container entrypoint unsets a list of related env vars
(`BACKEND_PORT`, `FRONTEND_PORT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_EXTERNAL`, `AUTH_ENABLED`, `POCKETBASE_URL`, etc.)
on every start and re-exports values from the JSONs. So: edit the JSONs,
restart, do **not** try to drive these with compose env vars.

| File | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `system.json` | Backend/frontend ports, public API base, CORS, SSL verification, attachment directory |
| `auth.json` | Optional auth toggle, username, password hash, token/cookie settings |
| `integrations.json` | Optional PocketBase and sidecar integration settings |
| `model_catalog.json` | LLM, embedding, and search provider profiles; API keys; active models |
| `interface.json` | UI language / theme / sidebar preferences |
| `main.yaml` | Runtime behavior defaults and path injection |
| `agents.yaml` | Capability/tool temperature and token settings |

The two settings most relevant to a fresh install:

- **`system.json` → `next_public_api_base`** (in-network) and
  **`next_public_api_base_external`** (cloud/external override). The
  entrypoint reads these and exports `DEEPTUTOR_API_BASE_URL`, which
  `web/proxy.ts` consumes. `public_api_base` is accepted as a
  compatibility alias and is normalized into
  `next_public_api_base_external` on save.
- **`system.json` → `backend_port` / `frontend_port`**. The container
  ports the supervisor binds inside the container. If you change these,
  update the right side of every `-p host:container` mapping (or the
  `HOST_PORT_*` env var that `compose.yaml` reads) to match.

Project-root `.env` files are intentionally ignored as application
config. The Web **Settings** page is the recommended editor for the
JSON/YAML files; deep links to each section live in the page sidebar.

---

## PocketBase

PocketBase is an optional auth + storage sidecar. Activate it by setting
`integrations.pocketbase_url` to `http://pocketbase:8090` in
`data/user/settings/integrations.json` and bringing the `pocketbase`
service up alongside the main `deeptutor` service. With it running, the
main app stores user accounts and sessions in PocketBase instead of
falling back to the SQLite single-user layout.

The `pocketbase` service in `compose.yaml` (and the corrected mount in
`docker-compose.yml`) bind-mounts three subdirectories of `./data` —
`/pb_data`, `/pb_public`, `/pb_hooks` — matching the upstream
`ghcr.io/muchobien/pocketbase:latest` image's entrypoint, which uses
absolute paths. The earlier `docker-compose.yml` example mounted
`/pb/pb_data` and crashed on first start with
`mkdir /pb_data: read-only file system`; this PR fixes that.

PocketBase stays a single-user integration — keep
`integrations.pocketbase_url` blank for multi-user deployments unless
you've wired up an external user store.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`CRIT could not write pidfile /var/run/supervisord.pid` on container start.**
Only on images built before the pidfile moved to `/tmp/supervisord.pid`
(`mode=1777`, always writable); current images don't emit it. The supervised
children come up either way — the line was always cosmetic. Fix: pull a
current image (or, on an old one, set the `/var/run` tmpfs to `mode=1777`).

**Page loads but Settings says "Backend unreachable".** The UI reaches the
backend through the in-container proxy, not a host port, so this is almost
always a backend that failed to start (check `docker logs deeptutor` for the
`[program:backend]` lines) or a wrong `DEEPTUTOR_API_BASE_URL` in a split
deployment — **not** a missing `:8001` host mapping (which the UI does not
need).

**`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon` on a podman host.** Run
`systemctl --user start podman.socket` (rootless) or set
`DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/$UID/podman/podman.sock` for the
`docker-compose` CLI to use the podman socket.

**`Permission denied` on first JSON write under a named volume.** This
is the userns-mapped root problem; switch to a bind mount on a host
directory you own, or use `:U` on the volume mount.

**`sed -i` errors on a fresh image.** There shouldn't be any — the
runtime no longer mutates the bundle. The URL is forwarded at request
time. If you see one, you are probably on an older image; pull
`ghcr.io/hkuds/deeptutor:latest` again.

**Settings page won't accept the API base URL.** Open
`data/user/settings/system.json` on the host and set
`next_public_api_base_external` directly. The page UI is wired to
`public_api_base` (the legacy alias) and the legacy field will be
renormalized on save.

---

## Security notes

- The image drops privileges to a non-root `deeptutor` user (UID 1000)
  before starting `supervisord`. Anything that runs as root is the
  entrypoint, the chown, and the env-var export.
- `read_only: true` plus `tmpfs:` for the expected writable system
  directories means the container's root filesystem is immutable at
  runtime. A process that tries to write outside the listed tmpfs
  paths or the bind-mounted `./data` tree will fail.
- `userns_mode: keep-id` on the host means a container escape lands
  with your host user's permissions, not root.
- The sandbox-runner sidecar (in `docker-compose.yml`, **not** in
  `compose.yaml`) is the strongest posture for untrusted model-generated
  code: a sandbox escape lands in a stripped, unprivileged container
  with no app secrets, not in the main app. The podman shape trades that
  for the rootless-podman shape; the main app falls back to `bwrap` or
  the restricted subprocess backend controlled by
  `sandbox_allow_subprocess`.
- Auth (`data/user/settings/auth.json` → `auth_enabled = true`) gates
  `/api/*` and `/ws/*` via the `dt_token` cookie. `web/proxy.ts` reads
  `DEEPTUTOR_AUTH_ENABLED` (exported by the entrypoint on every start)
  to decide whether to require the cookie.
- CORS uses frontend **origins**, not API URLs. With auth enabled, set
  `cors_origins` in `system.json` to the exact frontend origins the
  deployment serves.
